# Sending and Receiving text messages from RabbitMQ to Azure Service Bus

This sample has two parts: one that sends messages to RabbitMQ and another that receives messages from RabbitMQ.

## Running the sample with RabbitMQ

Start RabbitMQ : `docker compose -f src/main/docker/rabbitmq.yml up`.
Go to RabbitMQ console at http://localhost:15672 with username `guest` and password `guest` and create the two queues `foo` and `bar`.

RabbitMQ is listening on port `5677` (check the `application.properties` file).
It is a Spring Boot application and can be run with normal boot run methods, e.g.: `mvn spring-boot:run`

Send messages to both queues:

```
curl -G "http://127.0.0.1:8080/sendMessages" --data-urlencode "queue=foo" --data-urlencode "message=HelloWorld Foo"
curl -G "http://127.0.0.1:8080/sendMessages" --data-urlencode "queue=bar" --data-urlencode "message=HelloWorld Bar"

```

## Generating an OpenRewrite recipe with AI

Write an OpenRewrite recipe using YAML to migrate this SpringBoot application to Azure Service Bus. The output has to be well formatted YAML and YAML only. Here are the application characteristics:

* It uses a local RabbitMQ broker and I need to migrate it to Azure Service Bus.
* The Azure Service Bus server name is sb-openrewrite-3821.
* It sends text messages to two queues called `foo` and `bar`.

## Running the sample with Azure Service Bus

Execute the OpenRewrite recipe `rewrite-rabbitmq.yml`.
Deploy the Azure Service Bus instance and the two queues with the Azure CLI script `src/main/azure/deploy-rabbitmq.sh`.

Execute the Spring Boot application with `mvn spring-boot:run`

Send messages to both queues:

```
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8080/sendMessages" --data-urlencode "queue=foo" --data-urlencode "message=HelloWorld Foo"
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8080/sendMessages" --data-urlencode "queue=bar" --data-urlencode "message=HelloWorld Bar"
```
