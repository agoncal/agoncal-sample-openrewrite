# Receiving JSON From a Non-Spring Application

Spring AMQP applications communicating over AMQP using JSON add type information to message headers to enable the receiving application to convert the JSON to a class instance.

This sample demonstrates techniques to use for such conversion when the sending application is not a Spring app or if you wish to convert to a different type when receiving messages.

- Inferred type from `@RabbitListener` methods
- Parameterized types in template `receiveAndConvert()` methods
- `ClassMapper` id mapping configuration with a legacy POJO listener.

It is a Spring Boot application and can be run with normal boot run methods, e.g.: `mvn spring-boot:run`

curl -G "http://127.0.0.1:8080/sendMessages" --data-urlencode "queue=foo" --data-urlencode "message=HelloWorld"
