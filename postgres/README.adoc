# Querying local Postgres to Azure Posrgres

This sample fills a Postgres SQL with some data and exposes a REST endpoint to get the content of the database as JSON.

## Running the sample with locoal Postgres

It is a Quarkus application and can be run with : `mvn quarkus:dev`

Get the content of the database:

```
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8080/countries" | jq
```

## Generating an OpenRewrite recipe with AI

Write an OpenRewrite recipe using YAML to migrate this Quarkus application to Azure Postgres Flexible Server. The output has to be well formatted YAML and YAML only. Here are the application characteristics:

* It uses a local Postgres database and I need to migrate it to Azure Postgres Flexible Server.
* The Postgres Flexible server name is db-openrewrite.postgres.
* The database username is dbopenrewriteadmin.
* The database password is db-openrewrite-p#ssw0rd-12046.


## Running the sample with Azure Postgres

Execute the OpenRewrite recipe `rewrite-postgres.yml`.
Deploy the Azure Postgres database with the Azure CLI script `src/main/azure/deploy-postgres.sh`.

Execute the application with `mvn quarkus:dev`

Get the content of the database:

```
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8080/countries" | jq
